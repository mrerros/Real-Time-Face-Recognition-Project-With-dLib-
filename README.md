# Real-Time Face Recognition with Dlib

### Overview
This project is a real-time face recognition application using the Dlib library. It leverages the power of Dlib's facial landmark detector and face recognition capabilities to identify and track faces in real-time. The application is implemented in Python 3.11.

### Features
Real-time face detection
Face recognition and tracking
High accuracy with Dlib's pre-trained models
Simple and easy-to-use interface
